Welcome to Lily Redpath's repository for the SOFE 2800 "Web Programming" course for the fall 2024
semester at Ontario Tech University.

## Repository Structure
This repository is laid out in the following way:
```
<repository root>
|- .github
|- .vscode (Visual Studio Code configuration folder)
|- .idea (IntelliJ configuration folder)
|- assignments
   |- assignment1
   |- assignment2
   |- ...
|- labs
   |- lab1
   |- lab2
   |- ...
|- tutorials
   |- tut1
   |- tut2
   |- ...
```

### Assignments
All assignments are located in the `assignments` folder in their own subfolder. They may also be referenced
as a git submodule if they are required to be submitted as an individual repository.

### Labs
Every lab will always be referenced as their own git submodule, and will be located under the `labs` folder.

### Tutorials
Like assignments and labs, tutorial work will be located in the `tutorials` folder under their own subfolder. Each tutorial may also be
referenced as a git submodule if it's required to be its own repository for a submission.
